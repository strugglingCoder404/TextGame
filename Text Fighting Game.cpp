/*========================================================

After around a week of coding and just below 600 lines of
code, I have finished my first game...

I think, that this will be a long journey of better and
better games and programs. Thanks to TheCherno, who has
the IMO best tutorials on C++ on youtube out there.
Definitely check him out. If you more into WebDev, check
out Traversy Media. He is a great guy. I promised myself 
to donate him the first few dollars which I will ever
earn, because I am so thankful of him, bringing me to
programming. <3

If you are looking at this, and want to give me some
constructive criticism on this code or just ask me
anything, about myself or whatever then please Dm me on
Twitter @CoderDespair.

I don't know how far I will come in programming, but see
this as a message, that everybody starts small and nobody's
programs are immediately perfect!

Thank you! <3
